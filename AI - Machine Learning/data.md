# Data

* Numerical Data
  * Continuous Data
  * Discrete Data 
* Categorical Data
  * Ordinal Data
  * Norminal Data

## Numerical Data
* Quanitative Data
* Data that can be measured by numbers
* Examples: height, weight, number grade, age, etc
* Can use Statistics

### Statistics
* Mean:
```python
np.mean()
```
* Variance:
```python
from statistics import variance
variance()
```
* Standard Deviation
```python
from statistics import stdev
stdev()
```
* Using Histogram
```python
.hist(name of the data variable)
```


## Categorical Data
* Qualitative Data
* Data that cannot be measured by numbers
* Examples: sex, location, blood type
* Often use Frequency Distribution

### Frequency Distribution
* Frequency: value_counts()
* Relative Frequency: value_counts(normalize=True)
* Frequency Table

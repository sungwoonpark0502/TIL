# Data Processing

* Most of the datas are in the form that cannot be used as a machine learning model. This is why we need to transform the data, which is called data processing
* Data Cleansing is also needed to eliminate unnecessary datas like non-sense datas and missing values
* Splitting Data is dividing data into training data and test data

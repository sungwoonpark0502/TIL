## NumPy

* Numerical Python
* a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, __multi-dimensional arrays__ and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays
* Most of the datas could be seen as array of numbers
* Fast calculation and low memory compared to python lists

Using NumPy
```python
import numpy as np

npArr = np.array(range(5))
print(npArr) # [1 2 3 4 5] no commas
print(type(npArr)) # <class 'numpy.ndarray'> # ndarray: nth dimensional array
```

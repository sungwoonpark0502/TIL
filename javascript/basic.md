# Javascript

## Basics

```javascript
// printing hello world
console.log("Hello World")

// multi-line comment
/* 
Hello
World
*/
```
# Data Types and Variables

Data Types: undefined, null, boolean, string, symbol, number, and object
symbol: immutable primitive value that is unique
undefined: has not been defined
null: nothing
object: stores key and value pairs
```javascript
// declaring variable
var myName = "Sungwoon"
myName = "James"
myName = 10 // can change it

let myName = "Sungwoon"
myName = "James" // can change it
myName = 10

// constant variable
const pi = 3.14
```
Difference between var and let:
* var is going to be used througout the whole program
* let is going to be used in the scope of where I declared it
